# LACare-DataSciencePlatform-RFP-Demo2
This repository contains an R script to demonstrate the solution's ability to develop predictive models using popular open source data science libraries.

The "lending_club_predictive_modeling.R" script is a fully reproducible example to develop and compare 5 types of predictive modeling algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The data used is the "loan.csv" data found in the "lending-club-loan-data.zip" file housed on kaggle.com's site here: https://kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/downloads/lending-club-loan-data.zip

The goal of the script is to determine the model that is best at predicting which loans are "Charged Off" or "Fully Paid" (using AUC as the evaluation metric). The goal of the demonstration is to assess the solution's ability to install, load, and run libraries that would be leveraged in an actual use-case situation. Specifically, this demonstration will allow L.A. Care to assess the solution on the following Data Science Platform criteria:
- Import, Call, and Development of Open Source Predictive Models
- System Processing Speed
- Algorithmic Efficiency in One or Multi-Node Environment
- Data Pre-Processing
- Filtering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Data Visualization
- Model Testing and Validation 

If capable, vendors are encouraged to demonstrate their solutions' abilities to run the same models and produce similar outputs in a GUI/drag-and-drop type modeling environment (in addition to executing the provided script).
